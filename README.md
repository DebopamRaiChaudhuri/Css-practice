# CSS Practice – Interactive Website 

This repository contains my **CSS practice work**, where I focused on understanding and applying **core CSS concepts** by building an **interactive website**.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my fundamentals by combining **HTML structure with CSS styling and layout techniques**, and by implementing interactive UI elements such as a **dropdown menu**.
